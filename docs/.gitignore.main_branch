# The .github/workflows/djangoUvCi.yml workflow will automatically create the "build", "qa", and the "source" folders up on github
# - note: the source directory will be built from the following steps:
#   - the "sphinx-apidoc" command will create the rst files from the project source files into the "source" directory.
#   - also the nox "sphinxDocs" session will copy all of the files in the "sphinx_src" directory into the "source" directory
