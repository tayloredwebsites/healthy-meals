Continuous Integration (CI)
===========================


We may need to use the `Continuous Integration with Github Actions <https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/advanced/#use-pdm-in-continuous-integration>`_ feature for that the tests are all passing for the code passed up to the server.  See:  :doc:`Documentation Guide <docs_guide>` for current Documentation and QA reporting processes.
